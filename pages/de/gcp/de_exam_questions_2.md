You are working on optimizing BigQuery for a query that is run repeatedly on a single table. Teh data queries is about 1GB., and some rows are expected to change about 10 times every hour. You have optimized the SQL statements as mmuch as possible. You want to further optimize the query's performance. What should you do?

* Create a materialized view based on the table, and quer that view.

> A is correct because materialized view periodically cache the results of a query for inreeased performance. Materialized views are suiteed to small datasets that are frequently queried. Wehen underlying table data changes, the materialized view invalidates the affected portions and re-reads them.

<hr>

You are on a team of analysts who work with BigQuery and are already proficient in SQL. Your team needs to build a multi-label machine learning classification model that uses data in BigQuery. There are 6000 rows of data in your training dataset. The inferences could be on of 200 possible labels. You want to create a high accuracy model. What should you do?

* Connect the data from BigQurty to AutoML, and build the model in AutoML

> C is correct because the amount of data is relatively low and also varied. A model built using only this data wouldn't be accurate. AutoML is appropriate because it uses transfer learning based on other similar data.

<hr>

You used a small amount of data to build a machine learning model that gives you good inferences during testing. However, the results show more errors when real-world data is used to run the model. No additional data can be collected for testing. You want to get a more accurate view of the model's capability. What should you do?

* Cross-validate the data, an re-run the model building process

> B is correct because this model appears to be overfitting. Using cross-validation will run the validation on multiple folds of the data, which reduces the overfitting.

<hr>

#8 You are building new real-time data warehouse for your company and will use Google BigQuery streaming inserts.
