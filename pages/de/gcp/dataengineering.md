## The Role of a Data Engineer

A dataengineer builds data pipelines.

* Get the data where it can be useful
* Get the data in a usable condition
* Add new value to the data
* Manage the data
* Productionize data processes
<a/>

### Data Lake

Brings together data from multiple sources. Cloud Storage Bucket.

* Does it handle all types to data?
* Can it Scale?
* Does it support high throughtput ingestion
* Control to objects
* Can other tools connect easily
<a/>

### ETL

Extract, Transform, Load. Dataproc, Dataflow

### Real Time Analytics

Pub/Sub

## Data Engineering Challenges

* Access to Data
* Quality
* Computational ressources
* Query Performance

## BigQuery

Serverless Datawarehouse

### Data Lakes and Data Warehouses

![Storage Types](../../img/gcp_de_3.png)

Datawarehouse
* Can it serve as a sink for batch and streaming data
* Can it scale
* How is the data organized
* Is it designed for performance
* What it the maintenance level
<a/>

## Data Access

* Data Catalog
* Data Loss Prevention API (Manage sensitive Data)

## Cloud Composer (Airflow)

* How can we ensure pipeline health
* minimize maintenance
* respond to business needs
* are we using the latest tools?
