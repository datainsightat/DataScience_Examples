|Cloud Spanner|Values|Rows and Columns > Tables > Database|

### Data in Files and Data in Transit

![Data Types](../../img/gcp_de_exam_9.jpg)  

### Standard SQL Data Types

|Data type|Value|
|-|-|
|string|variable-length (unicode) character|
|int64|64-bit integer|
|float64|Double-precision decimal values|
|bool|true or false|
|array|ordered list of zero or more elements|

#### BigQuery is Columnar

![Columnar Storage](../../img/gcp_de_exam_10.jpg)

### Spark hides Complexity in RDDs

RDDs hide complexity and allow making decisions on your behald. Manages: Location, Partition, Replication, Recovery, Pipelining ...

![RDD](../../img/gcp_de_exam_11.jpg)

### Dataflow

#### PCollections

![PCollections](../../img/gcp_de_exam_12.jpg)

* Each step is a transformation
* All transformations are a pipeline
* Runner local, or in cloud
<a/>

* Each step is elastically scaled

* The result of an apply() is another PCollection
<a/>

#### Batch and stream processing

![Batch and Stream](../../img/gcp_de_exam_13.jpg)  

Bounded va Unbounded data. Dataflow uses windows to use streaming data. PCollections are not compatible with RDDs.

### Tensorflow

![Tensor](../../img/gcp_de_exam_14.jpg)

## Design Data Pipelines

### Dataproc

* Cluster node options: Single node, Standard, High availability
* Benefits: Hadoop, Automated cluster management, Fast cluster resize
* HDFS: Use Cloud Storage for stateless solution
* HBASE: Use Cloud Bigtable for stateless solution
* Objective: Shut down the cluster, Restart per job
* Data storage: Dont't use hdfs
* Cloud storage: Match you data locatoin with the compute location
<a/>

#### Spark

Spark uses a DAG to process data. It executes commands only, if told to do so = "lazy evaluation" (oppostite "eager execution).

![Spark](../../img/gcp_de_exam_15.jpg)

#### Dataproc can augment BigQuery

    projectId = <your-project-id>
    
    sql = "
      select
        n.year,
        n.month,
        n.day,
        n.weight_pounds
      from
        `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality` as n
      order by
        n.year
      limit 50"
      
    print "Running query ..."
    data = qbq.read_sql.gb1(sql,projectId=projectId)
    data[:5]

Extract data from BiqQuery using Dataproc and let Spark do the analysis.

#### Open Source Software

![Open Source](../../img/gcp_de_exam_16.jpg)

* Kafka > Pub/Sub
* HBASE > Cloud BigTable
* HDFS > Cloud BigStorage
<a/>

#### Initialization Actions

* Remove the need to manually change property files
* Specified by file_prefix:property=value

## Dataflow

* Java, or Python
* Based on Apache Beam
* Parallel tasks
* Same Code does stream and batch
* Input from many sources
* Put code inside servlet, deploy it to App engine
* Side inputs
* User dataflow users to limit access to Dataflow ressources
<a/>

### Pipelines

![Dataflow Pipeline](../../img/gcp_de_exam_17.jpg)

### Operations

|Operation|Action|
|-|-|
|ParDo|Allows for parallel processing|
|Map|1:1 relationship between input and output in Python|
|FlatMap|Non 1:1 relationships|
|.apply(ParDo)|Java for Map and FlatMap|
|GroupBy|Shuffle|
|GroupByKey|Explicit Shuffle|
|Combine|Aggregate values|

Pipelines are often organized in Map and Reduce sequences.

### Templates

## Exam Guide Review

### Storage

Selecting the appropriate storage technologies
* Mapping storage systems to business requirements
* Data modeling
* Tradeoffs involving latency, thoughput and transactions
* Distributed sytems
* Schema design
<a/>

>Be familiar with the common use cases and qualities of the different storage options. Each storage system or database is optimized for different things - some are best at automatically updating the data for transactions. Some are optimized for speed of data retrieval but not for updates or changes. Some are very fast and inexpensive for simple retrieval but slow for complex queries.

### Pipelines

Designing data pipelines
* Data publishing and visualization
* Batch and streaming
* Online (interactive) vs batch predictions
* Job automation and orchestration
<a/>

>An important element in designing the data processing pipeline starts with selecting the appropriate service or collection of services.  
>All Platform Notebooks, Google Data Studion, BigQuery all have interactive interfaces. Do you know when to use each?

### Processing Infrastructure

Designing a data processing solution
* Choice of infrastructure
* System availability and fault tolerance
* use of distributed systems
* Capacity planning
* Hybrid cloud and edge computing
* Architecture options
* At least once, in-order, and exactly once event planning
<a/>

>Pub/Sub and Dataflow together provide once, in-order, processing and possibly delayed or repeated streaming data.  
>Be familiar with the common assemblies of services and how they are often used together: Dataflow, Dataproc, BigQuery, Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub.

### Migration

Migrating data warehousing and data processing
* Awareness of current state and how to migrate design to a future state
* Migrating from on-premise to cloud
* Validating a migration
<a/>

>Technologically, Dataproc is superior to Open Source Hadoop and Dataflow is superior to Dataproc. However, this does not mean that the most advanced technology is always the best solution. You need to consider the business requirements. The client might want to first migrate from the data center to the cloud. Make sure everything is working (validate it). And only after they are confident with that solution, to consider improving and modernizing.

|-|-|-|-|
|Autoscaling and rebalancing handles variable volumes of data and growth|On-demand and distribution of processing scales with fault tolerance|Efficient pipelines + Efficient execution|Windowing, triggering, incremental processing and out-of-order data are addressed in the streamning model.|

#### Dataflow Windowing for streams

* Triggering: controls how results are delivered to the next transforms in the pipeline.
* Watermark: is a heuristic that tracks how far behind the system is in processing data from an event time.
* Fixed, sliding and session-based windows.
* Updated results (late), or speculative results (early)
<a/>

![Windowing](../../img/gcp_de_exam_27.jpg)

### Side Inputs in Dataflow

# Performance

* Input data and data sources (I/O): How many bytes does your query read?
* Communication between nodes (Shuffling): How many bytes does your query pass to the next stage? How many bytes does your query pass to each slot?
* Computation: How much CPU work does your query require?
* Output (materialization): How many bytes does your query write?
* Query anti-patterns: Are your queries following SQL best practices?
<a/>

## Schema

![Exam](../../img/gcp_de_exam_53.jpg)

Performance (De-Normalize) vs Efficiency (Normalize).  

### Nested Schemas

![Exam](../../img/gcp_de_exam_54.jpg)

## Key Elements of Performance

* I/O: How many bytes did you read?
 * Do no SELECT *
 * Filter using WHERE as early as possible
* Shuffle: How many bytes did you pass to next stage?
* Grouping: How many bytes do you pass to each group?
 * Works best if distinct number of groups is small
* Materialization: How man bytes did you write to storage?
* CPU work: User-definded functions (UDFs), functions
 * Limit UDFs to reduce computational load
<a/>

### Query Explamation Map

![Exam](../../img/gcp_de_exam_55.jpg)

## Partitioning
