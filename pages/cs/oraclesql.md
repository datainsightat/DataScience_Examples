## A 3: Retrieving Data

### Oracle Data Types

* varchar2(size): Variable-length character data
* char(size): Fixed-lenght character data
* number(p,s): Variable-length numeric data (precision  = number of digits, scale = decimals)
* date: Date and time values
* long: Variable-length data up to 2GB
* clob: Unicode character data. Up to 2,147,483,647 characters. Maximum size (4GB - 1) * (DB_BLOCK_SIZE)
* raw and long raw: Raw binary data
* blob: Binary large data. Up to 4GB
* bfile: Binary data stored in external file. Up to 4GB
* rowid: base64 number. Unique Row Address

### Describe Command

	desc[ribe] table_name;

### Select Statement

	select *|{column_name1,column_name2,...} from table;

### Column Aliases

	select first_name as name, last_name "Last Name", salary*12 "Annual Salary" from employees;

### Quote Operator

	select q'[My Name is Steven]' my_text from dual;

### Distinct and Unique Operator

	select distinct job_id from employees;

The distinct operator ist row-based only. One distinct operator is used in one select statement.

### Concatenation Operators

	select first_name || ' ' || last_name as "Names" from employees;

### Artithmetic Expressions

	select employees_id, salary, (salary + 200) * 12 as "Annual Salary" from employees;

	select sysdate + 3 from dual;

## A 4: Restricting Data

### Where Clause

	select *|{[distinct] column [alias],...}
	from table
	[where logical expressions(s)];

### Comparison Operators

* Comparison operators: =, <, >, <=, >=, <>, !=, between, in, like and null
* Logical operators: and, or, not

### Between ... And Operator

	select first_name, last_name, salary
	from employees
	where salary between 12000 and 15000;

### In Operator

	select employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, manager_id
	from employees
	where employee_id in (100,102,105,200);

### Like Operator

	select first_name, last_name
	from employees
	where first_name like 'A%';

* %: 0 or more characters
* _: 1 character

### Is Null Operator

	select first_name
	from employees
	where manager_id is null;

### Logical Operators (and, or, not)

	select first_name, lats_name, salary, job_id
	from employees
	where job_id = 'IT_PROG' and salary >= 5000;

	select first_name, lats_name, salary, job_id
	from employees
	where job_id = 'IT_PROG' or salary >= 5000;

	select first_name, lats_name, salary, job_id
	from employees
	where salary > 10000 and job_id not in ('SA_MAN','ST_CLERK','SH_CLERK');

### Rules of Precedence

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Concatenation operator
3. Comparison operator
4. is [not] null, like, [not] in
5. [not] between
6. Not equal to
7. Not logical operator
8. And logical operator
9. Or logical operator

## A 5: Sorting Data

	order by first_name desc, last_name asc;

### NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST Operators

	select first_name, last_name
	from employees
	order by 1 desc nulls first, 2 asc nulls last;

## B 3: Database Schemaobjects

* Tables
* Synonyms
* Views
* Materialized Views
* Constraints
* Database Links
* Indexes
* Functions and Procedures
* Packages

## B 7: Indexes

* Unique Index
* Nonunique Index
* B-tree Index (High cardinality)
* Bimap Index (Low cardinality)

### Create index

	create [unique|bitmap] index index_name
	on table_name (column_name1[,column_name2,...])

We cannot create more than 1 unique index on the same column.

If the index contains more than 1 column, the where-clause needs to address all columns of the index.

### Create Index on Table Creation

	create table employee_temp
	(employee_id number(6) primary key
		using index (create index temp_idx on employee_temp(employee_id)),
	first_name varchar2(29),
	last_name varchar2(25));

### Create Index after Table Creation

	create table new_emp2
	(employee_id number(6),
	first_name varchar2(20),
	last_name varchar2(25));

	create index emp_id_idx2 on
	new_emp2(employee_id);

	alter table new_emp2 
	add primary key (employee_id)
	using index emp_id_idx2;

### Function Based Index

	create index first_name_idx on employees
		(upper(first_name));

Index is active, if the propper function is used in the where clause.

	select * from employees
	where upper(first_name) = 'ALEX';

### Multiple Indexes on the same Column

	create index temp_idx on employees
		(first_name, last_name);

	alter index temp_idx invisible;

	create bitmap index temp_idx on employees
		(first_name, last_name);

### Drop Index

	drop index index_name;

To allow DML operations while the index is dropped use:

	drop index index_name online;

### Index Datadictionary

	select * from user_ind_columns
	where table_name = 'EMPLOYEES'
	order by index_name;

## B 8: Views

### Create View

	create [or replace] [force|noforce] view view_name
	[(alias[,alias]...)] as subquery
	[with check option [constraint contraint_name]]
	[with read only [constraint constraint_name]];

Aliases

	create view empvw20 as
	select employee_id eid, first*name name, last*name surname 
	from employees 
	where department_id = 20;

	create view empvw20 (eid, name, surname) as
	select employee_id, first*name, last*name 
	from employees 
	where department_id = 20;

### View Datadictionary

	select * from user_views;

### Drop View

	build [immediate|deferred]
	refresh [fast|complete|force] on [commit|demand]
	[[enable|disable] query rewrite]
	[on rebuilt table]
	as subquery;

For fast refreshed materialized views, you need to create a log on the basetable

	create materialized view log on table_name;

### Manually Refresh

	execute dbms_mview.refresh('view*name','F'|'C');

	dbms_mview.refresh_all_mviews(failures,'C','',TRUE,FALSE,FALSE);

### Periodic Refresh

	create materialized view view_name
	build immediate
	refresh force
	start with sysdate + 3/24
	next syssate + 5
	as subquery

## B 10: Advanced Subqueries

### Scalar Subquery

	select employee_id, first*name from employees
	where department_id = (select department_id from employees where upper(first_name) = 'LUIS');

		where b.department_id = a.department_id);

### Exists Operator

	select employee_id, department_id from employees a
		where exists (select 1, employee_id from employees
			where manager_id = a.employee_id);

### Not Exists Operator

	select department_id, department_name
		from departments d
		where not exists
		(select department_id from employees
		where department_id = d.department_id);

### With Clause

		select all_managers.employee, employees.manager_id, all_managers.department from all_managers, employees
		where all_managers.manager = employees.employee_id)
	select employee, manager, department from all_managers order by employee;

### Insert Data by using Subquery as Target

	insert into (select d.department_id, d.department_name
		from departments_temp d
		join locations l
		on (d.location_id = l.location_id)
		where l.city = 'Oxford')
		values (300, 'Marketing', );

	select * from departments_temp;

### Correlated Update

	update table1 alias1
		set (column, column, ...) = (select column, column, ...
			from table2 alias2
			where alias1.column = alias2.column);

### Correlated Delete

	delete from table1 alias1
	where column operator
